## Inspiration
We were inspired by how difficult it was to organize volunteer data (name, email, role, and hours) for both the admin and the volunteer.
## What it does
### For admins:
- Create an admin account
- Add volunteers (name, email, role, and hours), edit volunteer info, remove volunteers, and view volunteer info
- Can save account data
### For volunteers:
- Create an account
- Record volunteer hour details (date, total hours worked for that date, and description)
- View total volunteer hours
- Can save account data
## How we built it
We used GUI as our main output display and we used Java swing to make components like JButton, JLabel, JOptionPane, and more. 
There is a register and login page that is used to manage different accounts.
## Challenges we ran into
We tried to make an email system where you would be able to click on a button to send a verification email to show the volunteer name, email, role, and hours. We weren't able to get it working because google doesn't have the "allow less secure app" option anymore. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to store different information depending on which account it is.
Having different GUI screen if you are logged in as admin.
## What we learned
We learned how to save and retrieve data more efficiently so that we wouldn't mix up data for one account onto another account. We also learned more about the different manager layouts.
## What's next for Volunteer Management
We want it to be even better and hopefully add new features like making it into a spreadsheet, downloading it into a pdf, or finding a way to make it send a email to make it better for personal use.
