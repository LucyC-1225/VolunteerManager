## Inspiration
We were inspired by how difficult it was to organize volunteer data (name, email, role, and hours) for both the admin and the volunteer.
## What it does
For admins:
- Create an admin account
- Add volunteers (name, email, role, and hours), edit volunteer info, remove volunteers, and view volunteer info
- Can save account data
For volunteers:
- Create an account
- Record volunteer hour details (date, total hours worked for that date, and description)
- View total volunteer hours
- Can save account data
## How we built it
